# Project Rules

## Language and Code Standards

- Always work in English for code, comments, and documentation
- Primary programming language: TypeScript
- Compilation: Node.js
- Use TypeScript strict mode
- Follow TypeScript best practices and conventions

## Project Overview

This is a reservation and client management application.

## Development Phases

1. **Phase 1 - Console Application**: Start as a console/CLI application

   - Focus on core business logic
   - Implement reservation and client management features
   - Use Node.js runtime for execution

2. **Phase 2 - React Client**: After console app is ready
   - Build the client-side interface using React
   - Maintain separation between business logic and UI
   - Ensure the console app logic can be reused/refactored for the React client

## Code Organization

- Keep business logic separate from presentation
- Structure code to be reusable between console and React implementations
- Use proper TypeScript types and interfaces
- Implement proper error handling

## Best Practices

- Write clean, maintainable code
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Add comments where necessary (in English)
- Follow consistent code formatting
- Implement proper error handling
- Consider scalability from the beginning
