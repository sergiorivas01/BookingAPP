# BookingAPP - Reservation and Client Manager

A reservation and client management application built with TypeScript and Node.js.

## Project Overview

BookingAPP is a comprehensive system for managing reservations and clients. The project is being developed in phases, starting with a console application and later expanding to include a React-based web interface.

## Technology Stack

- **Language**: TypeScript
- **Runtime**: Node.js
- **Future Frontend**: React

## Development Phases

### Phase 1: Console Application
The initial development focuses on building a fully functional console/CLI application that handles:
- Client management (create, read, update, delete)
- Reservation management (create, read, update, delete)
- Core business logic and data operations

### Phase 2: React Client
Once the console application is complete and tested, a React-based web interface will be developed to provide a user-friendly graphical interface for the same functionality.
